# DST-Version-Checker
This script announces new releases of Don't Starve Together. 

# Setup
1. Create a file somewhere in your server. E.g. `touch /var/dst/version.txt`
2. Create two webhooks (one for mods and one for public) in your Discord server. See [Intro to Webhooks by Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
3. Add this script into the cron tab. So it updates everytime you want.
